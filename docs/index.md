<div class="subhead">Technical trainer with extensive software development experience</div>
I’m a geek with social skills who enjoys wrestling complex systems into submission, then using my knowledge of instructional design and adult learning principles to make them accessible to others. I’m equally comfortable learning a new development framework, creating an e-learning module, or delivering classroom training. I’m passionate about learning new technologies and helping others master them. 

Experience
----------
**Senior Technical Training Specialist at New Relic, Inc.**  
Portland, Oregon / April 2014 – present 

Founded in 2008, New Relic creates web-based tools for application performance management and digital intelligence; it employs about 1,300 people. As the first customer trainer in the company’s Customer Success organization, my assignment was to create a product training curriculum and teach customers how to effectively use New Relic’s products. 

* Using Action Mapping, determined which tasks customers must learn to use the products effectively. 
* Starting without existing content or curriculum, developed a series of 4 instructor-led courses. Delivered the first course within my first 90 days. 
* Created hands-on labs with sample applications in a variety of programming languages, running in Docker containers on AWS, to give students practice using New Relic to troubleshoot real applications. 

During 2016, developed and delivered a series of hands-on product workshops (in 22 cities and 3 countries), generating over 200 qualified leads and over US$1 million in sales. 

** Technical Trainer at Fiserv (formerly Corillian Corporation)**  
Hillsboro, Oregon / May 2005 – April 2014 

Fiserv employs over 20,000 people in 155 locations worldwide; my division created software for online banking and bill payment. I taught customers how to use Corillian products, and developers (both internal and external) how to create online banking applications on the Corillian platform. 

* Developed and deliver instructor-led training for developers and system administrators. 

* Developed and deliver virtual classroom (WebEx) training. 

* Used Camtasia and Articulate tools to create screencasts and e-learning. 

* Delivered internal training on developer technologies: C#, ASP.NET, jQuery, WCF, etc.

When I joined the team, our training was very content-focused: How do we deliver this _information_ to the learners? I try to focus on behavior: What should learners be able to _do_ after taking this training? I’m a huge proponent of Cathy Moore’s Action Mapping method: Start with a measurable business goal, figure out what learners must do in order to reach that goal, then give them the knowledge and skills necessary to perform those tasks back on the job. 

* In 2013, generated over $85,000 in training revenue. 

* Saved the company over $40,000 in vendor costs by developing and delivering technical training in-house.  

* Received Level 1 satisfaction scores of 4.64 out of 5. 

**Senior Support Engineer at Corillian Corporation**  
Hillsboro, Oregon / July 2004 – May 2005 

Corillian was a leader in online banking software with about 200 employees; it was acquired by Fiserv in 2007. As a Senior Support Engineer, I supported and maintained client banking implementations.  

* Troubleshot a wide variety of production issues. 

* Wrote code for client enhancements. 

* Demonstrated knowledge of ASP, ASP.NET, Visual Basic, C#, COM/DCOM, XML, SQL Server, and Windows system engineering. 

During my tenure I was able to resolve some thorny technical issues that had stumped more experienced engineers. I also developed and maintained good relationships with our customers, some of whom could be described as high-maintenance. 

**Independent Consultant at Netropole**  
Portland, Oregon / November 2003 – May 2004 

I worked with Netropole on a medical transcription application for the nation’s largest non-profit health care provider. I designed the SQL Server database and developed an ASP.NET web service interface to the database and the client’s mainframe, while mentoring less-experienced developers on the project. At the conclusion of the project, the client said: 

> _Phil is one of the rarest of breeds — he is a top-notch developer who has excellent business sense and is the kind of person you just want to hang around with. I recommend him highly._

Speaking and Publications
-------------------------
I have published over a dozen feature articles in a variety of technical trade publications. As a member of the INETA Speaker Bureau, I delivered technical presentations to .NET user groups throughout the U.S. I have presented advanced sessions at _VSLive!_ and other technical conferences in the U.S. and abroad.
